## Installation
1. Clone repository 
2. Run npm install 
3. Run npm run build to build the React app
4. Run npm start to start the api, and open Localhost:3080 to view the react app!

*To view immediate changes to the react application without needing to build, open
a second terminal, cd to howler, and run that application while running the main
node.js server. Now there is no need to build for development! Just make sure to
run npm run build before you push any changes.*
